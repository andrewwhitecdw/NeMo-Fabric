# Contribute an Adapter to NVIDIA NeMo Fabric

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` to keep the change scoped. Use `python-tests` for test
design, `maintain-packaging` for package or dependency changes,
`contribute-docs` and `review-doc-style` for public text, `validate-change` for
the validation matrix, and `prepare-pr` for review handoff.

Do not use this skill for a consumer application that only selects an existing
adapter. Use the consumer `nemo-fabric-integrate` skill for that work.

## Contract

Read the authoritative surfaces under References before editing. Use the closest
existing adapter only for harness-specific patterns, not the core contract.

Decide the following before implementation:

1. Choose the harness boundary: SDK/module, CLI/process, or service. Map it to a
   core runner: `process` accepts any executable regardless of implementation
   language, while `python` accepts its callable contract. Core runtime dispatch
   does not yet implement `http` service or `native_plugin` execution.
2. Place a repository adapter under `adapters/<name>`. Define its install extra
   and packaged descriptor. Choose the matching `harness.resolution` strategy,
   and document repository or `base_dir` descriptor discovery; wheel package
   data alone does not add a descriptor to core discovery.
3. Define how adapter-owned harness state is initialized in `start`, retained
   for continuation across repeated `invoke` calls on the same runtime, and
   released in `stop`.
4. List the normalized fields the adapter supports, partially supports, or
   rejects.
5. Identify fixed requirements, dynamic credentials, telemetry, workspace,
   state, and artifact needs.

## Implementation

- Use the existing Fabric `python` or `process` runner and normalized
  request/result contracts. Reuse `adapters/common/` only when its contract
  fits; do not add a runner or abstraction for one adapter.
- Use `adapters/<name>/` with `LICENSE -> ../../LICENSE`, `README.md`,
  `fabric-adapter.json`, language-native package and lock files, a source entry
  point, and focused tests. For Python, use `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`,
  `src/nemo_fabric_adapters/<name>/adapter.py`, and
  `tests/adapters/test_<name>*.py`. Keep the package independent and small.
- Keep published runtime dependencies (`[project].dependencies` for Python)
  razor-thin and adapter-owned. Do not declare the wrapped harness/SDK or
  libraries it already supplies, even when an SDK/module adapter imports their
  APIs; the host agent environment owns them. Declare other directly imported
  runtime libraries that the adapter owns. Keep wrapped-harness packages needed
  by repository adapter tests in the root `adapter-tests` dependency group, and
  other test-only dependencies in the appropriate non-published group. For an
  external process or separately managed harness environment, do not install or
  upgrade the harness or consumer agent environment.
- Start with the narrowest truthful `fabric-adapter.json`. Keep
  `config.accepts`, `config.generates`, requirements, telemetry declarations,
  and lifecycle capabilities synchronized with implementation and tests.
- Use the complete Fabric invocation for adapters that consume normalized
  config or runtime context. Treat `config`, `capability_plan`,
  `telemetry_plan`, and `runtime_context` as authoritative. Reserve
  `harness.settings` for harness-specific behavior.
- Apply precedence in this order: normalized `config`; Fabric-resolved plans and
  runtime context; harness-specific settings; descriptor and adapter defaults.
  Let intentional overlaps layer by this order. Reject conflicting duplicate
  declarations or unsupported behavior with an actionable error naming the field
  and supported alternatives; never silently drop configuration.
- Run dependency and authentication preflight: declare fixed dependencies in
  descriptor requirements, then validate selected versions, hooks, and
  credentials before invoking the harness. Never expose credential values in
  output, errors, events, logs, or fixtures.
- Forward only required system variables, selected credential variables,
  telemetry variables, and documented harness-specific environment. Never
  forward or log unrelated environment values.
- Start one local adapter host per Fabric runtime and keep it alive for ordered
  `start` → `invoke*` → `stop`.
  Emit one JSON lifecycle response per request on stdout and diagnostics on
  stderr; an early exit is a host crash. Return harness-level invoke failures in
  a successful lifecycle response as adapter output with `response: null`,
  `failed: true`, and structured `error` (`code`, `message`, `retryable`, and
  optional `metadata`); Fabric normalizes it into a failed `RunResult`.

> **TODO:** Revisit this output contract when Fabric adds streaming support;
> update this guidance and affected adapter evidence then.

- Scope workspace, generated config, state, sessions, and artifacts to the
  resolved runtime context. Stateful adapters must isolate Fabric runtime IDs.
- Keep stdout stable: emit `response` plus adapter-specific extensions such as
  `error`, harness `events`, `usage`, and session IDs. Fabric supplies top-level
  harness/adapter identity, lifecycle IDs, `status`, `error`, artifacts,
  telemetry, Fabric lifecycle events, and metadata when it builds `RunResult`.

Wire public adapter packages into language-native installation,
descriptor, build, catalog, and CI surfaces. For Python, add the package to root
optional extras, the adapter dependency group, `[tool.uv.sources]`,
`python_projects` in `justfile`, and applicable catalogs and CI enumerations;
ship its descriptor under `share/nemo-fabric/adapters/<name>`. Use
`maintain-packaging` to regenerate lockfiles and package artifacts.

## Capabilities and Policy

Use this table as the minimum capability review. Omit claims that the adapter
cannot implement and test end to end.

| Surface | Fabric input | Adapter responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Models | `config.models` and selected alias | Map supported provider settings and credential-variable names; reject unsupported providers. |
| Tool policy | `config.tools.blocked` and `capability_plan.tools` | Claim `tools.blocked` only when every harness tool path enforces it. |
| MCP | `capability_plan.native.mcp_servers` | Claim `mcp` only for supported native transports; reject unsupported routes or fields. |
| Skills | `capability_plan.native.skill_paths` | Validate and stage skill paths without cross-runtime collisions. |
| Telemetry | `telemetry_plan` and normalized telemetry config | Declare only providers, outputs, and integration modes the adapter implements. |
| Environment and lifecycle | `runtime_context` | Use resolved workspace, runtime ID, telemetry, and artifact context; claim only lifecycle operations implemented end to end. |
| Artifacts | Resolved artifact roots and normalized runtime config | Write within the resolved root and declare only files the adapter generates. |

Descriptor claims participate in planning and routing. Assert their exact
values in focused tests so capability expansion is review-visible.

## Evidence

Add only tests that prove adapter behavior or descriptor claims. Cover the
applicable cases:

- Descriptor shape and exact advertised capabilities.
- Positive mapping for each claimed normalized surface.
- Rejection of unsupported capability values and unenforceable policy.
- Successful and failed harness result normalization without secret leakage.
- One-shot execution, continuation across repeated invokes, and runtime
  isolation when stateful.
- A subprocess test of the packaged entry point to catch stdout, exit-code,
  interpreter, descriptor, and package-data failures.

Provide a credential-free fixture that exercises `plan`, `doctor`, and `run`.
Keep live-harness tests opt-in when they require credentials, but retain a
deterministic end-to-end path for CI. Inspect a built wheel when package data or
metadata changes.

Document installation, supported configuration, harness-only settings,
credentials, lifecycle, telemetry, artifacts, limitations, and focused test
commands in the adapter README. Provide a canonical typed SDK example and, when
the harness requires YAML, a canonical harness-native YAML fixture. Update docs
and examples together when they expose the changed behavior.

## Validation

Run `validate-change` and the applicable adapter commands:

```bash
uv sync --group adapter-tests
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/adapters/test_<name>*.py
just test-python
just lock-python && just wheels  # Package or dependency changes.
cargo run -p nemo-fabric-core --example generate-schemas -- schemas  # Schema changes.
cargo fmt --all -- --check && just test-rust  # Rust changes.
just docs  # Docs-site or generated-reference changes.
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
git diff --check
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Descriptor claims match implementation and positive, negative, and lifecycle evidence.
- [ ] Precedence, actionable rejection, forwarding, isolation, results, telemetry, and artifacts are tested.
- [ ] Package, runtime/test dependencies, installation, resolution, docs, SDK/YAML examples, fixtures, and generated artifacts agree.
- [ ] Generated files came from repository commands, applicable CI catalogs enumerate the adapter, and the diff has no contract drift or unrelated changes.
- [ ] Update this skill and affected adapter evidence when core changes adapter kinds, output framing, or lifecycle capabilities.
