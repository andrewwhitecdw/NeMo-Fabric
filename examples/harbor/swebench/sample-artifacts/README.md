# Relay Sample Artifacts

These bundles come from successful Harbor runs of
`swe-bench/django__django-13741` through Hermes Agent and Claude. NeMo Fabric reported
`succeeded`, Harbor's verifier returned reward `1.0` for both runs, and Relay
emitted both ATOF and ATIF.

Each harness directory contains:

- Relay's complete `events.atof.jsonl` and native ATIF trajectory;
- `trajectory.json`, the byte-identical ATIF copy promoted to Harbor's canonical
  path;
- concise NeMo Fabric, Harbor verifier, and telemetry summaries; and
- the resulting workspace patch.

Use these samples to compare Harbor's canonical trajectory with Relay's direct
ATOF and ATIF output before running the example yourself.

The checked-in trajectories record Relay 0.5.0 and the earlier
`nvidia/nemotron-3-nano` model identifier because they are historical evidence
from the original runs. New runs use the compatible Relay CLI version pinned by
[`prepare_swebench.sh`](../../prepare_swebench.sh) and the model selected in the
current walkthrough; do not treat sample metadata as installation guidance.
