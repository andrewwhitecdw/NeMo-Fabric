# <kbd>module</kbd> `nemo_fabric.models`
Pydantic SDK models for NeMo Fabric configuration and requests.

The Rust core remains the source of truth for persisted schema snapshots. These models provide the Python SDK's typed authoring surface and intentionally keep extension fields so consumers can carry adapter- or application-owned data without waiting for a schema release.



---


## <kbd>class</kbd> `FabricBaseModel`

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> extra_fields

Return fields preserved by the extension point for this model.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> model_extra

Get extra fields set during validation.



**Returns:**
  A dictionary of extra fields, or `None` if `config.extra` is not set to `"allow"`.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> model_fields_set
